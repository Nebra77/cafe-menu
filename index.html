    <h2>Sandwiches</h2>
    <li class="popup" onclick="popPhobosPhilly()"> Phobos Philly $10
  <span class="popuptext" id="PhobosPhilly">A space-age twist on the Philly cheesesteak, the Phobos Philly includes thinly sliced protein-cultured beef substitute seared with Martian-grown onions and bioluminescent green bell peppers. Melted faux cheese drips into a crusty, steam-baked roll grown from fungi-based flour. The sandwich is named after Mars’ fearsome moon, Phobos — and packs enough kick to keep your adrenaline high on rough rover days.</span> </li>
      <p></p>
      
        <li class="popup" onclick="popTerraformerTurkey()">Terraformer Turkey Club $12
  <span class="popuptext" id="TerraformerTurkey">This triple-decker sandwich features lab-grown turkey slices layered with rehydrated hydroponic lettuce, Earth-imported tomato paste, and algae bacon for a smoky crunch. All sandwiched between toasted "terraform wheat" bread — a blend developed specifically for Martian atmospheric conditions. Served with a side of spiced lentil chips and a small vial of mineral-enriched aioli, it's a favorite among engineers for its calorie count and nutrient load.</span> </li>
      <p></p>
      
        <li class="popup" onclick="popFirestormBLT()">Firestorm BLT $15
  <span class="popuptext" id="FirestormBLT">This bold sandwich lives up to its name with spicy algae-smoked bacon, fire-roasted tomato slices, and crisp bio-dome lettuce, all stacked inside a red pepper-flavored Martian flatbread. A smear of jalapeño-mayo (cultured from Martian fungi and Earth spices) brings heat that lingers like a dust storm. The Firestorm BLT is popular among habitat chefs and miners who need a fiery lift during long work rotations.</span> </li>

    <h2>Drinks</h2>
        <li class="popup" onclick="popRedDustEspresso()"> Red Dust Espresso $11
  <span class="popuptext" id="RedDustEspresso">Brewed from Earth-imported, genetically modified coffee beans adapted to Martian soil conditions, the Red Dust Espresso packs a bold, smoky flavor with a signature reddish crema — tinted with powdered beetroot and a hint of volcanic ash salt. Served in a vacuum-insulated demitasse, it’s the colonists’ go-to for a quick jolt during solar storm lockdowns.</span> </li>
      <p></p>
      
      <li class="popup" onclick="popSolarInfusedTeas()"> Sola Infused Teas $11
  <span class="popuptext" id="SolarInfusedTeas">Crafted using a 24-hour slow-drip method in low gravity, this cold brew features a silky texture that almost floats in the mouth. Infused with trace minerals from Mars’ water recycling systems (triple-filtered, of course), it offers subtle earthy undertones. Nitrogen-charged and served in a pressure-sealed tumbler, it delivers a frothy, weightless pour that mimics sipping coffee in orbit</span> </li>
      <p></p>

      <li class="popup" onclick="popCryoCocoa()"> CryoCocoa $11
  <span class="popuptext" id="CryoCocoa">This hot chocolate is a colony favorite after long shifts outside the dome. Made with reconstituted dairy proteins, rich dark chocolate powder, and infused with freeze-dried marshmallow puffs, CryoCocoa is flash-heated in thermal mugs to mimic the warmth of a campfire. The name nods to both the icy temperatures outside and the cryo-storage units where ingredients are kept. A sprinkling of "ice dust" — a fine blue sugar — gives it a frosty finish even when piping hot.</span> </li>
      <p></p>

      <li class="popup" onclick="popLowGColdBrew()"> Low G Cold Brew $11
  <span class="popuptext" id="LowGColdBrew">These herbal teas are steeped using concentrated solar mirrors, capturing the raw energy of the Martian sun. Herbs are grown hydroponically inside the bio-domes, including lemongrass, mint, and Martian basil. The result is a naturally sweet and calming beverage served in clear glass mugs etched with topographical maps of the Valles Marineris. Popular options include the Sunrise Steep (lemongrass-lavender) and Crimson Camomile (chamomile with hints of red hibiscus).</span> </li>

    <h2>Dessert</h2>
      
      <li class="popup" onclick="popMarsMacaroons()"> Mars Macaroons $11
  <span class="popuptext" id="MarsMacaroons">These chewy red-tinted coconut macaroons are made with freeze-dried berries and a dash of Martian vanilla — a synthetic extract developed in hydroponic labs. Their dome-like shape is a subtle tribute to the pressurized living pods of Martian colonies. Lightly toasted with solar oven tech and dusted with powdered cocoa imported from Earth, they’re a sweet bite of luxury in the dusty red expanse.

</span> </li>
      <p></p>
      
      <li class="popup" onclick="popChocolateLavaMooncakes()"> Chocolate Lava Mooncakes $11
  <span class="popuptext" id="ChocolateLavaMooncakes">Styled after lunar tradition but baked for Mars, these dense chocolate mooncakes contain a molten core of warm ganache that "erupts" when sliced. The outer shell is decorated with craters and topographic lines, mimicking the Noctis Labyrinthus region. Made with algae oil, fungal flour, and rich cocoa powder, they're best enjoyed on rest days — or after mission success ceremonies at the colony café.</span> </li>
      <p></p>
      
      <li class="popup" onclick="popCraterCroissants()"> Crater Croissants $11
  <span class="popuptext" id="CraterCroissants">These golden pastries are shaped to resemble the rims of Martian craters, with crater-like divots filled with a micro-dose of fruit jam or spiced nut paste. Made from laminated sheets of Martian barley and Earth-imported butter substitute, they’re baked in low-pressure ovens to get the signature flake and rise. Served warm, often with a side pipette of honey-replica syrup made from modified algae enzymes.

</span> </li>
      <p></p>
      
      <li class="popup" onclick="popFreezeDriedFruitBites()"> Freeze Dried Fruit Bites $11
  <span class="popuptext" id="FreezeDriedFruitBites">These are small, crisp cubes of apples, strawberries, peaches, or Martian-grown melons, freeze-dried to retain nutrients during long-term storage. Packed in resealable, static-resistant foil pouches, they make for easy snacking on hikes to lava tubes or science outposts. Some varieties are coated with a fine layer of tangy electrolyte dust to help balance hydration levels in dry Martian air.
