# Oasis Caf√© ~ Space-Themed Project

## Project Description

Oasis Cafe is a fun, and interactive website themed around a fictional martian cafe. It features a creative sci-fi menu and a contact us form, and it bult with a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It mimics how a real restaurant webpage would work, but we used imaginative food and drink items from Mars!
## Features

#### We built an Interactive menu page
It displays three sections: Sandwiches, drinks, and desserts. each menu item has a hidden description that appears when clicked. This is handled with our knowledge and application of JavaScript and how it used pop-up effects.

#### Pop-Up descriptions
Each food item uses a function that toggles a hidden <span> to make it visible, showing a description for each item. It is styled with CSS and animated to fade in when clicked/opened.

#### Contact Page
This is a form where users can submit their name, email, and messsage. It includes a dropdown for categories and buttons for preferred contact methods. THis simulates a real fillable form, although this does not connect to a backend, (yet)

#### Theme
The whole site is styled to match a Martian atmosphere, using warm colors like orange, red, and brown. Pop-ups have unique styling with rounded corners and animations.

## How it Works

#### JavaScript adds interactivity by toggling CSS classes when items are clicked
#### CSS animations make the pop-ups appear smoothly
#### The HTML is divided into semantic sections for easy reading and layout
#### index.html - Main menu page
#### contact.html - Contact page
#### style.css - Stylesheet
